A decentralized virtual power plant that utilizes advanced demand response techniques to efficiently manage energy supply and demand. The product will use Time-of-Use (TOU) pricing, real-time pricing, direct load control and dynamic pricing to incentivize customers to shift their energy usage to off-peak hours, reducing the overall demand for electricity during peak hours. Additionally, the virtual power plant will leverage ADR technology and IoT to better understand and respond to changes in energy demand, and use blockchain technology to create a decentralized demand response system. The virtual power plant will also use game theory to create a more efficient and effective demand response system, incentivizing customers for their energy reduction.
This product will provide customers with a convenient and user-friendly platform to monitor and manage their energy usage, allowing them to make informed decisions about when to use energy and when to conserve, ultimately leading to cost savings for the customer and a more sustainable energy grid for everyone.
